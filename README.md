A work in progress. Basically, you give pyBullet a list of tasks to run in the shell, and once it's done it sends a pushbullet notification. Split multiple commands with commas. For now things like aliases don't work.

A word of warning, this was coded on Windows and I've had some issues with line endings. I'll fix this in the future.
